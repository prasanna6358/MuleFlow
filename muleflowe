How to stop or start a flow.

There is 2 ways to do in runtime:- 1) Use Groovy component to start a flow :-

<scripting:component>
    <scripting:script engine="groovy">
        muleContext.registry.lookupFlowConstruct('targetFlow').start()
    </scripting:script>
</scripting:component>

where targetFlow is the name of the flow you need to start

or Second way is :- Use a expression component to start a flow ... here flow1 is the name of the flow to start :-

<expression-component>

    app.registry.flow1.start();

  </expression-component>


using groovy we can stop  a flow for certain seconds
using script groovy 
sleep(10000)-->milliseconds
System.out.println("holding the flow for 10 seconds");
return message.payload;
